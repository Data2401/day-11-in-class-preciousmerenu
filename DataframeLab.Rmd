# Working with loaded in csv files


Use the `read.csv()` function to read the data from the `gates_donations.csv` file (available on Canvas, make sure you save it in the project repository folder) into a variable called `grants` 

```{r}
## if you save it in the same folder as this file this should work. 
## But you may need edit the string to reflect the actual file name: 

grants <- read_csv("gates_donations.csv")


head(grants)
```

Because you're in an RProject, you don't need to set your working directory in RStudio! The working directory is automatically set to the repository location. (You can use `getwd()` to confirm this)

- Use the glimpse function to look at the loaded data

```{r}
glimpse(getwd())

```


- Create a variable `org` that contains the `organization` column of the dataset

```{r}
org = grants$organization
print(org)
```


- Confirm that the "organization" column is a vector using the `is.vector()` function. (This is a useful debugging tip if you hit errors later!)

```{r}
print(is.vector(grants))


```


Now you can ask some interesting questions about the dataset:

- What was the mean grant value?

```{r}
print("These are the col names of the grants dataframe.")
print("______\n")


colnames(grants)
#___

print("This is the mean of the grants total amount. ")
print("______\n")


grants_mean = mean(grants$total_amount)
print(grants_mean)
```


- What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?

```{r}
print("This is the organization that recieved the largest dollar amount: ")
largest_grant = grants$organization[which.max(grants$total_amount)]
print(largest_grant)

print("______")
print("This is the corresponding grant dollar amount: ")
largest_grant_amount = which.max(grants$total_amount)
print(largest_grant_amount)
```


- What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?

```{r}
print("This is the organization that recieved the smallest dollar amount: ")
smallest_grant = grants$organization[which.min(grants$total_amount)]
print(smallest_grant)

print("______")
print("This is the corresponding grant dollar amount: ")
smallest_grant_amount = which.min(grants$total_amount)
print(smallest_grant_amount)
```


- Which organization received the largest grant?

```{r}
print("This is the organization that recieved the largest dollar amount: ")
largest_grant = grants$organization[which.max(grants$total_amount)]
print(largest_grant)

```


- Which organization received the smallest grant?

```{r}
print("This is the organization that recieved the smallest dollar amount: ")
smallest_grant = grants$organization[which.min(grants$total_amount)]
print(smallest_grant)
```

- How many grants were awarded in 2010?

```{r}
awarded_post_2010 = if grants$`\Grant start date` == 2010
print(awarded_post_2010)
```

- How much was awarded in 2010? 

```{r}
awarded_during_2010 = 
```


# Working with built-in data sets

Load R's "USPersonalExpenditure" dataset using the `data()` function

This will produce a data frame called `USPersonalExpenditure`
```{r}
data("USPersonalExpenditure")
```

The variable `USPersonalExpenditure` is now accessible to you. Unfortunately, it's not a data frame (it's actually a matrix, you can find that out using) 

Test this using the `is.data.frame()` function:

```{r}
is.data.frame(USPersonalExpenditure)
```

Luckily, you can pass the USPersonalExpenditure variable as an argument to the `data.frame()` function to convert it a data frame.

Do this, storing the result in a new variable

```{r}

```


What are the current column names of your dataframe?
```{r}

```


Consider: why are they so strange? (Think about whether you could use a number like 1940 with dollar notation!)

What are the current row names of your dataframe?
```{r}

```


Add a column "Category" to your data frame that contains the rownames

```{r}

```

Consider how this data isn't tidy. Use the `pivot_longer()` function from last class to make the data tidy. 

```{r}

```


How much money was spent on personal care in 1940?
```{r}

```


How much money was spent on Food and Tobacco in 1960?
```{r}


```


What was the highest expenditure category in 1960?
```{r}


```


Define a function `lowest_category` that takes in a year as a parameter, and returns the lowest spending category of that year
```{r}



```

```{r}

```


Using your function, determine the lowest spending category of each year
Hint: use the `sapply()` function to apply your function to a vector of years

```{r}

```
